# C#
some projects I was messing around with in C#. The purpose is to stay familiar with the language and tools.

## Projects
- banking console app is a simple console app that takes a json file and updates it with changes
- wpf app is coming soon(updating once I'm done building my pc)
## future projects
- blazor
- wpf app
- .net mvc or web app
- and maybe xamarin

#### dotnet cli commands
create a new project....these are just reminders for me
- `dotnet new console -o <project name>` creates a new console app
- `dotnet new classlib -o <project name>` creates a new class library
- `dotnet new webapp -o <project name>` creates a new web app
- `dotnet new mvc -o <project name>` creates a new mvc app
- `dotnet new blazor -o <project name>` creates a new blazor app
- `dotnet new wpf -o <project name>` creates a new wpf app
- `dotnet new console -lang F# -o <project name>` creates a new console app in F# (might be used to do data science stuff) 
run a project
- `dotnet run` runs the project
- `dotnet run -p <project name>` runs the project
