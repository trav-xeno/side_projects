# SWIFT UI - PLAYGROUND
small projects to relearn swiftUI/swift and to see what changed since that last time I played around with swift


### setup system
since I am on a mac I simply creatred a playground in xcode and started to code but...
- <code> swift package init --type executable </code> to create a swift package
- <code> swift build </code> to build the package
- <code> swift run </code> to run the package
- <code> swift test </code> to test the package
