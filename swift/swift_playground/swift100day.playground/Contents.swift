 There are three things in there you need to look at closely:

 We write for number: Int: the external name is for, the internal name is number, and itâ€™s of type Int.
 When we call the function we use the external name for the parameter: printTimesTables(for: 5).
 Inside the function we use the internal name for the parameter: print("\(i) x \(number) is \(i * number)").
